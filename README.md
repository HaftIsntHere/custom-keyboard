# Custom Keyboard
This is my fully custom keyboard, fitted with a 75% layout, 2 macro keys, a knob and an oled screen!

I made this project as a continuation for the hackpad, and I really wanted to know how building a real keyboard is, not just a macropad. This helped me finally understand how keyboards really work!
